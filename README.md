# Sentiment Analysis

A Python-based sentiment analysis project using machine learning models to classify text as positive, negative, or neutral. This project demonstrates data preprocessing, model training, and evaluation using classic NLP techniques and scikit-learn.

## 🚀 Features

- Text preprocessing (stopword removal, lemmatization)
- Feature extraction using TF-IDF Vectorizer
- Training with multiple classifiers:
  - Logistic Regression
  - Naive Bayes
  - Support Vector Machine (SVM)
- Evaluation metrics (accuracy, confusion matrix, classification report)
- Model persistence using `joblib`

## 🧠 Technologies Used

- Python
- Pandas, NumPy
- Scikit-learn
- NLTK
- Matplotlib & Seaborn (for visualization)
- Joblib (for saving models)
